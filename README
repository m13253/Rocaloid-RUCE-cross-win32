Cross compile script to win32 for Rocaloid-RUCE
===============================================

Before building, please install MinGW-w64 cross compile toolchain.
For example, on ArchLinux, `sudo pacman -S mingw-w64-toolchain`

Then run `./build.sh` and wait.

If anything goes wrong after trying twice,
please submit an issue attaching build.log.
